Build a blockchain and cryptocurrency. Discover the engineering ideas behind Bitcoin and Ethereum!

The course is designed into sections that introduce the main concepts of the blockchain one-by-one. By the end of the course, you will have a respectable blockchain project in your repertoire.

Some of the main course highlights:

Build a Blockchain in the object-oriented programming style.

Generate hashes for blocks in the chain.

Unit Test Components of the Blockchain.

Create an API around the Blockchain.

Create a real-time connected peer-to-peer server.

Implement a proof-of-work algorithm.

Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.

Create a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.

Include transactions in core blocks of the chain.

We’ll use NodeJS to implement this project. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with JavaScript. This course explains the purpose behind every line and keyword. So, while JS experience will help, it’s not an absolute requirement.
